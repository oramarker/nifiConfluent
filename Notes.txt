Nar depencencies.

Each NAR can only have a single NAR dependency. Typically we package the Controller Service APIs together or establish a chain. By establishing a chain this is building a transitive NAR dependency. Any Controller Service APIs bundled in ancestor NARs will be available.

Note, I'm specifically calling out Controller Service APIs as the implementations of the Controller Services do not need to be in this NAR dependency chain I'm describing. They can be bundled in a separate adjacent NARs that share the same Controller Service API NAR dependency.
